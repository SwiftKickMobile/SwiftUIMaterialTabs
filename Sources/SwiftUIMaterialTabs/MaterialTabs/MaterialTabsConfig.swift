    ///   2. User switches to tab B and scrolls up (a.k.a swipes down) until the title view is expanded
    ///   3. User switches back to tab A

        /// should be collapsed and will remain expanded if the user scrolls up, which could severely limit the space for scroll view content if the header
        /// is unusually tall.
